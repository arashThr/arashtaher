<p>Software engineer with over 8 years of experience across finance,
gaming, and customer-focused web platforms. I believe in building with
empathy, and I actively use and study the products I help develop to
better understand the customer journey.</p>
<p>I thrive in environments where engineers take ownership, not just of
code but of outcomes, and where teams are empowered to solve meaningful
problems. I’ve also begun integrating AI into my development workflow
and tooling, and I’m a strong advocate for using it to accelerate
product innovation.</p>
