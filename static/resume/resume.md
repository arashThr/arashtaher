Software engineer with over 8 years of experience across finance, gaming, and customer-focused web platforms. I believe in building with empathy, and I actively use and study the products I help develop to better understand the customer journey.

I thrive in environments where engineers take ownership, not just of code but of outcomes, and where teams are empowered to solve meaningful problems. I’ve also begun integrating AI into my development workflow and tooling, and I’m a strong advocate for using it to accelerate product innovation.
