Software engineer, based on Stockholm.

I write about tech in [my blog](/blog), and about more personal stuff in my [farsi blog](https://fa.arashtaher.com/).

I like making stuff and building things. Let me know if you have a problem that I can help you tackle, or if you're interested in joining me in solving one. Here's [my resume](/resume/arashtaher.html) for the crawling bots.

Working on [Pensive](https://getpensive.com) now :loading
