Having a second pair of glasses dedicated to reading and computer work has had multiple benefits for me. Here's why you should consider it:

First and foremost, no more eye strain or headaches. After long stretches of time on the computer, I used to experience mild headaches and my eyes would feel incredibly dry. That is completely solved now that I have a pair with a lower prescription that I only use for working on my computer or reading.

It’s a constant reminder to clean your glasses. This might sound lame, but it’s real for me. Instead of mindlessly cleaning my glasses with my shirt (which can cause scratches) or just living with a smudged view, the act of switching pairs is my cue to clean them properly. Life is just better with a clearer view, man!

You get a whole new style. You only live once, so you might as well have a couple of different looks while you're at it. A second pair of glasses is an easy way to switch things up.
