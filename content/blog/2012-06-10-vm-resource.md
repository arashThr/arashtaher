title: An introduction to Virtual Memory
---

I myself had some problems grasping what virtual memory is and how it manages memory. After a lot of reading and surfing, I found these resources much more comprehensive than others. So if you want to start to know what virtual memory, page table, TLB, etc., are, I recommend checking out these websites:

- [A conscious overview on VM: What is happening underneath VM in detail](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~solomon/cs537/html/paging.html) (Highly recommended)
- Another resource that might come in handy is a series of videos by Dr. Murphy, which is available on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw1B-U0Frws&feature=BFa&list=SP56B156F5D73BBD77).
- You may also find a bunch of tutorials about OS (including Memory management, kernel programming, and more) [here](http://www.osdever.net/tutorials/index "OS Developers").
