![default](/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/default.jpeg)

A rudimentary implementation of a [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) for Scheme programs in Python (as usual). Descriptions for implementation have been taken from chapter 4 of the SICP book. At its core, it's merely an Eval, Apply cycle. [Enjoy it](http://ge.tt/6UdsX7m/v/0).
