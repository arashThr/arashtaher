title: Concurrency problems
---

In this semester, I've taken a course in Concurrency. One of the most delightful courses I've ever taken. As an exercise, I started to work on some classical and less-classical problems on concurrency from ["A little book on semaphores"](www.greenteapress.com/semaphores/ "Green tea press, A little book on semaphores") by Daweny. The result of my attempts is a bunch of codes in Python (and one in C) which you can download from [here](http://ge.tt/8gpNhuI/v/0?c "Concurrency problems solution").

The solved problems include:

- Producer-Consumer problem (also available in C)
- Dining philosophers
- Dining Savages
- River crossing problem
- Barbershop problem
